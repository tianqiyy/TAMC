## TAMC
TAMC (Transcriptional factor binding prediction from ATAC-seq profile at Motif-predicted binding sites using Conventional neural networks) is an open source tool for predicting motif-centric TF binding activity from paired-end ATAC-seq data. TAMC takes advantage of signal processing strategies in HINT-ATAC and TOBIAS to prepare input signals and make predictions of binding probability using a 1D-conventional neural network (1D-CNN) model.
